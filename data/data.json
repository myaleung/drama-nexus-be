After graduating from law school, she announces her plans to marry her American boyfriend Alex, a fellow attorney. But her father is strongly opposed to the match, because he has his heart set on her marrying Kim Yeo-joon, the son of his best friend who lives back in Korea. He orders her to meet the bachelor that they picked out for her before she goes ahead and marries Alex. Sang-eun finds herself exiled to Korea, where she reluctantly teams up with Yeo-joon, who is focused on his career and equally uninterested in marriage, to devise a plan that will allow them to avoid their impending wedlock.",
